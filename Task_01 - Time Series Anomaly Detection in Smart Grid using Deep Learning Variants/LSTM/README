This is a sample code of LSTM. It is borrowed from : https://www.renom.jp/notebooks/tutorial/time_series/lstm-anomalydetection/notebook.html

The dataset is borrowed from: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set

This coding will be used as a foundation for all other Anomaly Detections algorithms in Task 01.

This code will be modified for other models such as GAN, AE, Transformer, etc.
