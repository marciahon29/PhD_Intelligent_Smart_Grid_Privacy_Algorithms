This dataset is adopted from Kaggle competition : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set

It has been modified for:

- data for one month
- Date/Time changed to consecutive numbers
- Only used the column "Global_active_power"
- all "?" replaced by 0
- 45036 total rows
- 45000 to 45036 contain the anomaly of value "9"

This is only a test dataset. For the formal case, I will investigate a larger dataset and also replace "?" by the mean
