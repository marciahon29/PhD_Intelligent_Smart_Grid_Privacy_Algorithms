From 45000 to 45036, the value of "9" was deliberated fixed in order to introduce an anomaly.

In this code, an anomaly is detected through the "Mahalanobis' distance".

Clearly, in the last graph, we can see that, indeed, the Mahalanobis distance is greatest from 45000 to 45036. Thus, indicating that there is an anomaly.
